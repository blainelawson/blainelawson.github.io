I've come to the end of my coursework and there is one thing I would have liked to have done differently: I should have made friends on Flatiron at the beginning. Having someone to lean on, to talk to, to express to, and especially to **vent** to has made a huge impact on the Redux section. I wish it hadn't come so late.

I'm a little reclusive and definitely don't mind--nay, sometimes I even prefer!--to learn alone, but having a friend out there to ask questions throughout the day and check-in on them has made every day of coding a much more enjoyable and rewarding experience. But it has done so much more than boost my morale.

Having a friend to reach out to on slack has actually improved my coding.  Whenever I have trouble, I've been able to give my friend a break to distance themselves from their current brain drain and see my particular issue with a fresh perspective.  My friend has been able to point out inconsitencies and make suggestions. And we've been able to approach coding with two heads as opposed to one.

It has definitely shown me where my competencies are and where I'm lacking. Often, other's strengths can be your weaknesses and the other way around. So it's definitely a morale boost when you have a friend who asks you a question and you realize "hey, I know this!" And it's totally cool to give that opportunity to someone else.

In short, find a friend. I found mine during a study group and it just took one slack message--in this case, she reached out to me--to start your path through the Flatiron curriculum together.
