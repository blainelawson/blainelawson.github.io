I don't know how many times I've sought out to accomplish something grand--or small, it doesn't really matter--just to be smacked in the face with some sort of error. I'm told this is "the life of a developer." Nearly always, the resolution is something simple and it's always something different than what you've tried over and over again. Don't be insane, try something different.
