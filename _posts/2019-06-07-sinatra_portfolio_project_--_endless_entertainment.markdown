I can't believe how far I've come since the last project (CLI) and how much more entertaining it is to be coding a project that appears much more relevant. The CLI project, while great for learning the basics in developing objects seems lightyears in the past. Who uses CLI's these days on the user end?

Enter: Sinatra and ActiveRecord. Not only are we able to develop on the back end, we can design a user experience that looks and feels like something from this century. We're building fully functional websites and I am amazed at the simplicity of the basic functions of platforms like Twitter as well as how tediously complex the inner workings are. From building the views to constructing various routes and making sure that information is only edited (or even accessed) by the appropriate--authenticated--user takes time and deliberation.

You know what still sucks, though? CSS.
